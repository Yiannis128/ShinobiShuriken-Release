# ShinobiShuriken-Release

This repo contains just the built executables of the game. Due to the game using assets and sounds that belong to SEGA,
I have decided not to share any owned assets. If you would like access to the source code (excluding art and sounds),
then contact me.

This project was created for demonstration purposes and is in no way intended to replace the original game.
